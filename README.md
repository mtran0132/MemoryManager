# MemoryManager
Written in C++, the MemoryManager was means to better understand pointers. The program runs by the user pressing "Enter" a couple of times.

>Computer languages often require a way to dynamically allocate memory. This means that memory is acquired while the program is running.
>This is in contrast to static memory allocation such as declaring a variable, an instance of an object or an array of some data type.

#Features 
*65536 byes of memory available to the user
*Keeps track of how much memory is available
*Keeps track of how much memory has been used

#Key Concepts to Understand
* Pointers
 * char
 * short
 * int
 * void
* Arrays
* Type Casting
* Byte Size  
I'm not sure if byte size stays constant but for MemoryManager these are the sizes I used
 * char = 1 byte
 * short = 2 bytes
 * int = 4 bytes
